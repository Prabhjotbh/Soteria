You may (but are not required to) consider the following information as you develop your solution to this challenge:

Guidelines

As an example, your process could analyze and suggest improvements to a NASA standard such as NASA-Standard-5018, Strength Design and Verification Criteria for Glass, Ceramics, and Windows in Human Space Flight Applications (See Resources section).
You can use any software you wish when developing your tool, but remember that NASA judges cannot download software to their computers.
You may utilize any resources mentioned in the Resources section, but do not feel limited by that list.
You can clearly describe the process you followed to develop the app and provide instructions for using the app.
You can submit the source code for your app along with a brief report explaining your approach and methodology.
When proposing to insert text, you could use brackets to indicate the insertion: This [is] an example.
When proposing to delete text, you could use “XX” to indicate the deletion: This is XXisXX an example.
Make sure the app’s output is not manually altered!
Output considerations

Recommendations generated by your app can include:
The section number and version letter of the document under review
The current language from that section
The identified issue
Suggested language or modification
The source of each recommendation
Output from your tool could resemble the (fictitious) example below:
NASA-STD-5018 Section: 4.5.3
Current Language: The installation of the window into the vehicle/element shall not cause: a. Damage to the glass over the service life of the vehicle. b. Deterioration of the sealing capabilities over the service life of the vehicle.
Issue: The term "damage" in point (a) is somewhat broad. It may benefit from a more specific definition or inclusion of examples to clarify what constitutes as damage. This can reduce ambiguity during inspections or assessments..
Suggested Language: For the purpose of this standard, "damage" to glass windows encompasses the following:
Cracks or Fractures: Any visible or microscopic fracture in the glass that compromises its integrity or performance, including stress cracks, edge cracks, and impact cracks.
Delamination: Separation between layers in laminated glass, compromising its structural or visual properties.
Scratches or Abrasions: Visible or tactile marks on the surface which might impede clarity or compromise structural strength.
Chips or Pitting: Small and localized loss of glass material either from the surface or edges.
Discoloration or Hazing: Any change in the visual properties of the glass leading to reduced transparency, including fogging or development of a milky appearance.
Bubbles or Inclusions: Presence of air pockets or foreign materials within the glass that were not intended as part of the original design.
Seal Failure: Signs of moisture or foreign matter within multi-pane windows, indicating a failure of the sealing system.
Thermal Stress: Evidence of damage caused by extreme temperature variations, often leading to spontaneous breakage or weakened structural properties.
Chemical Damage: Alteration or deterioration of the glass due to contact or reaction with external chemicals or environmental factors, including etching or corrosion.
Source: General knowledge of common types of damage that can occur to glass, particularly in contexts where its integrity and clarity are critical. This knowledge is informed by a combination of materials science, industry standards, and common practices related to glass manufacturing, installation, and maintenance.
Keep in mind that

Poor solutions might have many incorrect or nonsensical recommendations and require significant prompting to generate useful results.
Good solutions can simplify the process of filtering out irrelevant or inappropriate recommendations, leading to less labor required to review the suggestions.
Great solutions can be capable of ingesting the full text of source documents (e.g., PDF files) and provide recommendations with clear benefits and justifications, enabling comprehensive analysis and improvement suggestions.
Even better solutions can provide actionable recommendations with minimal prompting, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
Phenomenal solutions can also incorporate security measures, such as firewalls, to enable the safe processing of sensitive information.
