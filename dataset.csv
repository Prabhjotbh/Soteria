5,EVENT CODE ,,
5.1,How to Code ,,
Several investigative tools exist. Investigators can use this NASA Handbook along with the,,,
Quick Reference Guide (QRG) during the analysis. Another tool is the Human Factors,,,
,15 of 38 ,,
,NASA-HDBK-8709.25 
"Investigators Checklist. Prior to implementation, check the OSMA Human Factors Web page",
(sma.nasa.gov/sma-disciplines/human-factors) to ensure this is the latest version of the,
"NASA Handbook, the Investigators Checklist, and the QRG. In addition to investigative tools, a ",
list of Center Points of Contact (POCs) is maintained at this Web page. These POCs are trained,
"in NASAHFACS and may assist in performing the analysis, utilizing the NASA Mishap",
"Information System (NMIS), or Human Factors report writing. Enter Human Factors data into",
NMIS using the NMIS Human Factors module. Events and coding from NMIS are included in,
"the Agency’s Annual Human Factors Report. For Type A, Type B, or high-visibility events, a",
NASAHFACS analysis will be performed by the Human Factors member. If the area of,
"investigation expertise cannot be obtained within NASA, the investigating authorities’ members",
may be appointed from another Agency. ,
"NPR 8621.1, Mishap and Close Call Reporting, Investigating, and Recordkeeping, requires a",
"Human Factors analysis for Type A, B, and high-visibility events. Additionally, NPR 7900.3, ",
"Aircraft Operations Management, requires a Human Factors analysis for all aviation Type A, B,",
"C, D, and high-visibility close call events. ",
5.2,NASA Mishap Investigation System 
"If you don’t already have a NMIS account, contact your Center Mishap Program Manager to",
gain NMIS access. This allows your entry of event data and analysis to the event. After you join,
"the HFTF and complete certification or are assigned to a Mishap Investigation Board (MIB),",
initiate a NASA Access Management System request for access to the Human Factors Analyst,
role. This opens the permissions to code and provide justifications for findings within the event,
reported in NMIS. NMIS can then produce a report for the identified Human Factors findings. ,
"When serving on a MIB, it is helpful to review the latest version of NPR 8621.1 for required",
SATERN training for Mishap Investigations. ,
5.3,Human Factors Investigators Checklist 
Those without access to the NMIS Human Factors Analyst role may use the Human Factors,
Investigators Checklist. The Checklist is available on the OSMA Human Factors Web page,
(sma.nasa.gov/sma-disciplines/human-factors),in the outreach section. The Checklist records
"factors identified in each Tier, Category, and Nano-Code for tracking and trending purposes.",
"Each block of the Checklist (except NMIS Event Number and Investigator’s Name) has a 4,000-",
"character capacity and, when printed, allows for complete reading of the block. This Portable",
Document Format file may be uploaded as an attachment to the NMIS Event analysis. This,
Checklist contains an Executive Summary section to provide context to the Human Factors,
findings. ,
5.4,Primary Review 
"Conduct interviews or review witness statements, Policy and Procedure documents, appropriate",
"checklists, training records, and any other related material associated with the event. Provide",
appropriate security and confidentiality methods as directed by other NASA requirements.,
Perform coding of each event by use of this NASA Handbook and the QRG. Record findings on,
the Human Factors Investigators Checklist to capture results. Provide analysis with an executive,
,16 of 38 
,NASA-HDBK-8709.25 
summary incorporating all findings. Provide analysis and Human Factors Investigators Checklist,
to Mishap Board Lead or Center Mishap Program Manager for records keeping. Retain analysis,
and Checklists as directed by local Center retention guidelines. Utilize the electronic version of,
this Checklist and upload as an attachment to the NMIS event to include findings in NMIS as,
part of the record if access to Human Factors module as an analyst is not available. ,
5.5,Secondary Review 
"Gather all associated documents (including the written or electronic report, Corrective Action",
"Plan, checklists, etc.) of the incident being analyzed. Review witness statements, Policy and",
"Procedure documents, appropriate checklists or training records, and any other relevant related",
material associated with event. Provide appropriate security and confidentiality methods as,
directed by other NASA requirements. Perform coding of the event by use of this NASA,
Handbook and the QRG. Record findings on the Human Factors Investigators Checklist to,
capture results. Provide analysis with an executive summary incorporating all findings. Provide,
analysis and Human Factors Investigators Checklist to Mishap Board Lead or Center Mishap,
Program Manager for records keeping. Retain analysis and checklists as directed by local Center,
retention guidelines. Utilize the electronic version of this Checklist and upload as an attachment,
to the NMIS event to include findings in NMIS as part of the record if access to Human Factors,
module as an analyst is not available.\ ,
6,ANALYSIS CHARTS FOR TRACKING AND TRENDING 
6.1,Tracking and Trending 
"After coding, transfer the data collected / list generated from the Checklist into a simple bar",
chart. See the example in Figure 6. This chart provides a graphic record of the factors identified,
"and along with the Checklist Executive Summary, provides a visual context to the factors. Color",
coding of the chart to match the QRG is beneficial. This chart may be used to report all events,
"within a code, Center, or project / program, or an individual NMIS Event. ",

8,DIRTY DOZEN 
The OSMA Human Factors Dirty Dozen initiative is an awareness campaign that is a byproduct,
of the Agency Human Factors Annual Report. In the spirit of Gordon Dupont’s contribution of,
"the same name to the aviation safety community, OSMA has expanded its application to address",
Human Factors contributing to mishaps Agency-wide. The Dirty Dozen is a top twelve list that,
highlights the most common factors contributing to mishaps and close calls within NASA over,
the previous fiscal year. The monetary and lost time impact is an immediately addressable issue,
relevant to current Agency operations. ,
"To broaden the campaign, OSMA is issuing monthly Human Factors messages with case studies",
focused on contributing factors identified in the Dirty Dozen. The case studies are developed,
with the intent to equip Agency stakeholders with information and mitigation strategies for,
factors found to be the leading contributors to loss at NASA. ,

9,RED-LIGHT / GREEN-LIGHT: MISHAP INVESTIGATION AND
RISK ASSESSMENT ,
9.1,Mishap Investigation: 
 Learning from accidents and incidents remains a vital component of a mature safety system.,
"Sometimes called “Safety I”1, traditional analysis focuses on understanding the underlying",
factors associated with adverse events. Those findings drive actions and recommendations to,
reduce their recurrence.,

,NASA-HDBK-8709.25 
9.2,New Approach: 
NASA’s newly created HF approach is more comprehensive regarding Human Factors by,
examining the factors that impact consequences in a positive way. This latter approach to safety,
utilizes a method colloquially referred to as a “green-light (GL)” analysis. GL analysis identifies,
"positive aspects of a safety system to promote resilient behaviors and processes, in addition to a",
traditional “red-light (RL)” analysis that seeks to eliminate errors of commission or omission.,
This GL approach reflects a more robust and rigorous safety analysis that current safety,
"programs lack. This more comprehensive system supports resilient systems, what is currently",
referred to as “Safety II”1. ,
9.3,From lagging to leading indicators: 
"Beginning in 2023, the NASA Safety Culture Program uses RL/GL for analysis for its Safety",
"Culture Survey (SCS) comments. In addition to the traditional sentiment analysis, comments are",
distributed in their proper HF category. Below is a notional example of RL/GL from the NASA,
SCS comments. It moves Human Factors analysis into identification of leading indicators for,
"prevention purposes. Resilient systems use leading (e.g., survey) along with lagging (e.g.,",
mishap) data for mission success. We believe this new taxonomy and approach has many future,
"applications within NASA and outside of NASA in government, academia, and industry. ",
,Figure 6: Notional RL/GL SA HF Overview 
9.4,Implementation of RL/GL: 
The Human Factors Program extends beyond mishap investigation. The multi-year effort from,
2021-2023 by the HFTF to “neutralize” the taxonomy created a structure to understand areas for,
"mitigation and reinforcement. The NMIS system includes an updated Human Factors module,",

"allowing for RL/GL coding. Starting in 2022, all NASA Human Factors annual reports include"
RL/GL analysis of operational cases in the NASA Mishap Database. These annual reports are in
"the NASA STRIVES system, available to those with required permissions. "
