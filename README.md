Nasa Space Apps Challenge 2023

SUMMARY
Greetings, space enthusiast! Are you tired of slogging through technical requirements, only to find omissions and inconsistencies that could spell disaster for your mission? What if there was an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered app called STAR (Standards Technical Assistance Resource) that could streamline the process and offer requirement recommendations? Your challenge is to develop the approach, code, or procedure for STAR, so that with STAR as a copilot, mission designers can blast off with even greater confidence, knowing that they have the right requirements in place.

The aerospace industry is an integral part of our modern world, impacting various aspects of daily life. From air travel and navigation systems that connect people and businesses worldwide, to satellites that provide communications that enable global connectivity and collect crucial data for weather forecasting and disaster management, the aerospace industry is vital to our society. It also drives advancements and innovations in fields like Earth observation, climate monitoring, and space exploration.

Ensuring the safety, reliability, and effectiveness of aerospace products is paramount, and it starts with well-maintained technical requirements. However, managing these documents accurately and efficiently is a complex, time-consuming challenge. In a rapidly evolving technological landscape, identifying a solution that streamlines the management of these critical documents, while ensuring quality and consistency, is essential to bolster the foundation of the aerospace industry and enhance safety and efficiency.

Regardless of your background, a basic understanding of the industry's significance and the importance of good requirements provides you with the necessary foundation to tackle this challenge. Addressing the inconsistencies and errors in these documents can create a safer and more reliable aerospace industry, impacting millions who rely on air travel and satellite services. Problems with requirements are consistently identified as a reason for project failure.

By engaging in the search for creative alternatives and solutions, you will contribute to the development of safer, more reliable, and universally harmonized aerospace products. Join this exciting journey and make a lasting impact on the aerospace industry and the lives of people around the world, including your own.
